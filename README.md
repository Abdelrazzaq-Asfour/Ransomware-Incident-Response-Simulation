# 🛡️ Ransomware Incident Response Simulation

## 📌 Scenario
Health Services, a regional healthcare provider, was hit by a severe ransomware attack that encrypted core patient records, disrupted operations, and raised serious patient safety concerns.
I was  trained with the full response lifecycle.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Assess the impact of the ransomware attack.
- Contain the infection and prevent further spread.
- Conduct a digital forensics investigation.
- Recover encrypted data and resume operations.
- Train staff to strengthen cybersecurity posture.

## 🔍 Phases of Response

### 1. 🔒 Incident Containment
- Disconnected infected systems.
- Blocked external command-and-control  traffic.
- Preserved volatile memory and logs for analysis.

### 2. 🧪 Forensics Investigation
- Identified phishing email as the initial attack vector.
- Malware: LockBit ransomware variant.
- Attackers exploited outdated RDP and weak user credentials.
- Collected evidence to support potential legal action.

### 3. ♻️ Recovery and Restoration
- Verified backup integrity from three days prior.
- Restored Electronic Health Records  system.
-  validate restored patient data.
- Documented recovery gaps and patient data re-entry procedures.

### 4. 👥 Cybersecurity Awareness Training
- Developed training on phishing identification and secure practices.
- Conducted simulations and monthly awareness campaigns.
- Created escalation plan for suspected future incidents.

### 5. 🧩 Lessons Learned
- Backups must be isolated (air-gapped).
- Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) should be deployed.
- Staff awareness is as critical as technical defenses.
